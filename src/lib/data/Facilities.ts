		content: `In the rapidly evolving landscape of industries transitioning into AI-centric entities, the imperative for educational institutions to cultivate and adapt AI engineers cannot be overstated. These establishments must boast the faculties equipped with practical experience in cutting-edge technologies. Moreover, the provisioning of state-of-the-art systems and workstations within these educational hubs is indispensable. This ensures that students gain hands-on exposure to AI development on a global scale, fostering a practical understanding of the field. The AI Skill lab at our institute boosts students' skills beyond basic projects. With top-notch systems and powerful GPUs, students can tackle complex projects that demand significant computing power. GPUs have transformed machine learning, overcoming past limitations and driving progress in areas like image processing and video analysis, and popularizing technologies like autonomous driving and facial recognition. This lab is where students gain hands-on experience with these cutting-edge tools.'`,
